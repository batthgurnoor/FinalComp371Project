## Architecture

This project demonstrates:
- **Singleton Pattern**: GameController ensures single instance
- **Observer Pattern**: UI observes game state changes
- **Strategy Pattern**: Difficulty levels as strategies
- **Service Layer**: Separated business logic
- **Clean Architecture**: Models, Controllers, Services, Components

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed documentation.

## Team Contributions

- **Noor**: Game Logic & Classes (Card, GameBoard, CardManager, MatchChecker)
- **Danish**: Controller & Patterns (GameController, Observer, Strategy patterns)
- **Harmitha**: UI & Player Interaction (Components, Player, ScoreManager, GameHistory)
